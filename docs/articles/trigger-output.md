## Trigger playback of output channels

In addition to the hardware trigger channels, playback of output channels can be triggered by the ['Trigger Output Channels'](xref:Bonsai.PulsePal.TriggerOutputChannels) operators. This is useful for close loop stimulation experiments. (Provide some sample workflows here like image threshold detection, lever pressing, etc)
